			<p>
				I am Alejandro Seguí Díaz, hobbyist game developer and a C++ fanboy. I love to <a href="">create videogames</a> and
				<a href="{{site.url}}/other-projects">working on everything related to them</a> in my spare time:
				artificial intelligence, procedural generation, 3D/2D graphics, mechanics design, game design documents.
			</p>

			<p>
				I also like to try new frameworks and libraries to develop these games, or developing my own frameworks trying new approaches and
				practicing. I use to have personal projects always rolling around. I have participated in a good bunch of game jams using Allegro,
				SDL, LibGDX, Löve2D or Unity3D among other techs. When needed, I can also draw a few ugly sprites or compose some dumb and short loops.
			</p>

			<p>
				Among my development interests you can also find computer vision and general purpose artificial intelligence. I have mainly worked with 
				C++ using CMake and GNU toolchain, but other strengths are C#, Lua, Java and Python.
			</p>	

			<p>
			My <a href="{{site.url}}/resume">working experience</a> is varied: C++ development, full stack web applications and game development. Feel free to check my resume for more information
				on this.
