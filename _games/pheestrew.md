Pheestrew is a mix of rogelike and classic JRPG where you are a random hick called Pheestrew
that has some elemental abilities. The game features abilities that are upgraded and requires
a bit of thinking to pass through higher levels easily. Generally there are weakening abilities
that ease your way through random battles. The objective is to collect the necessary gems and
pass through all levels (but it's infinite).
