This game was started for the LibGDX game jam, but the aim was too high and it is **unfinished**, so this ended up being a nice prototype of a procedurally generated metroidvania with constraints based on abilities that need to be adquired during the game. Rooms are created with Tiled and loaded and placed depending on the constraints for each room.
