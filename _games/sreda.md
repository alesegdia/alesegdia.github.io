Sreda Vniecaps is an inverted space invaders with a very intrincate story where you take control of
alien ships. Take your way through 3 levels facing the (maybe) enemy humans. Bored of earning
points in arcade games that doesn't have any use? no problem, you can waste your points in upgrading
shields or shoot, or even regenerating destroyed ships.
