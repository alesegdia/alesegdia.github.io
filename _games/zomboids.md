As the title of the jam suggests, the goal of this game was to try some AI techniques. The ones being tested
here are map generation and flock based AI movement. Sprites are simple but I managed to put some cool effects
in the game so that it didn't seem so austere. Also asked **jorgefdz** for a title screen art.
