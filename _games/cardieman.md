CARdieMAN is a simple game I made for a class assignment which *was* published in the Google Play Store just
because someone else tried to do it on its own. The game is very simple, you just have to jump over all
hazards you'll get in your way: cars, skaters and even UFOs.

The game is not present in the Google Play store because I got tired of updating the game because of Google Play's terms change.
