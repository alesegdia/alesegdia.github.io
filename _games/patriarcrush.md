Even being a prototype, the game is fully playable and enjoyable, just as a no-brainer match3 where you just make lines. This game was started as an entry for the Familiar Game Jam #8, but I did not submit it because of its simplicity and incoherency with the theme. The game is a joke about the famous spanish brand of *polvorones* and *mantecados*, *El Patriarca*, and it themes its products. The best one is the one with the blue and white wrap, the *Pequibom*.
