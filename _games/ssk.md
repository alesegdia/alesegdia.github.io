StarShipKillers started as an experiment and it has stayed as that without being finished. The
idea was to have some kind of hybrid control where you can move a ship like in any shoot'em'up game
but also having the ability to scroll the window as you wish with the mouse. Thanks to **jorgefdz**
for the big enemy mothership and **nosgoth** for the smaller enemy ship. It would be nice to continue
this one in the future.
