Asroth is the result of a week of work in a procedurally
generated shooter platformer highly based in SNES jewel Demon's Crest,
with all respects. The game features a nice variety of shoot types that you
can buy as well as other upgrades that enhance your flying abilities. The code for the generator
called **platgen** can be found in a separated repository.
