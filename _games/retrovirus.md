In Retrovirus you incarnate a Virus that has to pass through all nodes in an organism. You have to be careful
with the stealth, so that you are not detected by antibodies and can go your way easily through all the levels.
I managed to build an editor so that team members could work on maps easily and quickly.

Graphics by **nosgoth** and **jorgefdz**. Sfx and music by **V4N171N06**.
