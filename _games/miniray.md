At Miniray you are a hacker inside a virtual world who has to go his way through levels. I ended up
decoupling the engine from this, who was called GLRayFW, because of the nature of the games that
can be done with it: Wolfenstein3D-like games. I also used it to learn a bit of modern OpenGL. The game is in a very
early stage although it was started long ago. I really plan on retaking this one in a future.
