The rise of the elementals, a prophecy spread by word of mouth among people of Lodenia, but unlike most prophecies, this one has come to be true. But fear not, my child, since the ancient dragon knight will arise from the heart of the planet to overcome the evil menace of the machines. In this game you need to resolve a sequence of stars by killing enemies of the same color. Graphics by **[TheMiwes](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMiwes)**
