Acronym for Simple Entity Component System. After studying and working on the data oriented
ECS approach
through the time, I started working on SECS in order to have an usable ECS framework.
Before starting this project I have started others like [artecshpp](https://github.com/alesegdia/artecshpp)
or
[ecscpp](https://github.com/alesegdia/ecscpp) just to
fiddle with the ins and outs of this approach. Also I have used the ECS approach in some jams,
which let me prototype faster and have much more variety of game object kinds by combining
different components.
