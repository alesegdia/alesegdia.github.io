Framework made to help myself on building games quickly. Because of my love for LibGDX, I built
this framework highly based on it on some parts. I have been using this in jam games as in
long-term ~~unfinished~~ projects. It is using only **allegro** right now, and it provides
helper classes to build spritesheets, animations, sounds, music, input and game screens,
nothing too fancy.
