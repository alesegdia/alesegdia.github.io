Answer Set Programming is a form of declarative programming
oriented toward difficult (NP-hard) search problems. In this project
I sketched the few first steps of my final university project of building
a map generator with a search based method and several difficult constraints.
The investigation using this method ended in order to build a more practical
approach using Java and common procedural programming.
