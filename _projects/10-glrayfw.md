Framework to build Wolfenstein3D-like games using OpenGL 3+ and Box2D. This is currently
being used in Miniray, and has been used to learn modern OpenGL techniques. The status of
this project is quite advanced, but still needs work on game logic, which is being done
using a simple Entity/Controller approach.
